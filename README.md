## Introduction ‚òÅÔ∏è
**About Cloud Computing and Generative AI** <br>
Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. It allows you to focus on developing, rather than having to worry about providing all the hardware. One of the biggest cloud service providers out there is AWS. <br>
Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to generate new content, data, or outputs that are not explicitly programmed in advance. It involves models that can create new examples or samples within a given domain, such as images, text, music, or other types of data.
