# CIC genAI Hackathon 2024

## Introduction ‚òÅÔ∏è

**About Cloud Computing and Generative AI** <br>
Cloud Computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer. It allows you to focus on developing, rather than having to worry about providing all the hardware. One of the biggest cloud service providers out there is AWS. <br>
Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence designed to generate new content, data, or outputs that are not explicitly programmed in advance. It involves models that 
can create new examples or samples within a given domain, such as images, text, music, or other types of data.

### Data (extending the LLM)

#### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) aims to improve prediction quality by using an external datastore at inference time to build a richer prompt that includes some combination of context, history, and recent/relevant knowledge

- [What Is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/)

## Examples / Ideas ü§î

### Amazon Bedrock Series

- GitHub Link: [RAG-Bedrock-Titan](https://github.com/janakiramm/rag-bedrock-titan)
- Video: [Implementing RAG with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Titan - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIw_Ivvrp8g)

From the creator: "In this tutorial, we will build a chatbot based on the Retrieval Augmented Context generation technique. Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is used as the vector database, Amazon Titan is used for generating text embeddings and as an LLM, and Amazon Bedrock API is used for invoking the Titan model."

### ICBC Chatbot

A chatbot that uses the ICBC website information as its knowledge base to answer questions that are asked by the users who want to learn more about driving licenses, insurance, and anything ICBC-related. This website can be hosted on an EC2 instance. This chatbot can be based on the [Flask Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), which provides a light-weight python-based web framework. 

### Course Textbook Chatbot

A chatbot generates responses to students‚Äô prompts about content in a course textbook. This chatbot can be created using Amazon Bedrock to generate responses to prompts and Streamlit for the user interface. A Knowledge Base can also be used to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate responses based on information retrieved from a specified data source, such as a course textbook PDF.
